           data (DATA)
     connection (CONN)
    computation (COMP)

    🌎 the internet
    ☁️ the cloud
    ꩜ the grid     

       the website
       the (social) network
       the browser
       the app



DATA is the most valuable asset in the world

DATA becomes valuable via mass CONN & COMP

🌎 made mass CONN possible

☁️ made deep, high-trust COMP possible

the COMP power of personal devices is orders of magnitude greater than the cloud, and the gap is widening

today, we


websites are public CONN delivering low-trust COMP

the app


(let me tell you a story)

the website problem

an existential problem

what is a website
    - first few years
    - biggest website offer

fuck it, just call it "website"
no... "AI websites"
there's enough we know we need to resolve,
    come back later...

    -

we reached important milestones
    - marketing, technology
but, we fell drunk on "website",
    the very thing ___
people don't care about websites
    (drill ___)
WHAT IS ___???
idk, but i know what the most valuable ones are
    - Facebook
    - Google
    - etc

more important, than what is a website? where is the value?

it appears value follows where connection is amassed

    where we connect with the people we work with, the people we love, our customers, where anyone can tune in to Trump in real time

    where we can share files & feelings

    where all our data can be connected and computed on en masse
    where AI has the prima-materia to work its magic

looking at what our customers were doing ___,
    I relized,
        the website is the destination,
            but the journey is what matters

    - costs / dev / efficiency
    - security, wordpress hacked, privacy issue (mixed accounts from bug)
    - couldn't scale
    - costly thus poor perf

the connections

secular tail winds... WTF
the cloud
the cloud made us thing app vs website

the problems of the cloud




the Grid
    an internet of apps    ... appnet

foundation for private networks of
    hi-trust user-user connection
    hi-perf decentralized computation


the cloud
    an internet of websites & services
built upon public networks of
    lo-trust connection
    lo-perf computation

the browser





# TECH

> locality, security, power

    1. The kinds of computation
        - ai, constraints
        - power, power, power
        - OS / browser (the trust fallacy)
    2. The kinds of connection
        - ossification!
        - http fails
        - blockchain fails
        - p2p fails
        -> pluralistic
    3. The data
        - locality = perf, security, equity
        - the cloud fails
        - website/app is a false distinction
            - from the client-server paradigm, the cloud  
        - from legacy thinking of
             "me & my device are not to be trusted with the connections I make"
             "instead, I should send all my data to another more trusted machine, who will decide ___"
             "we have been moving our data, and thus our trust & equity to computation "in the cloud""
             "to devices collected in the millions, controlled by silicon valley socialists"
             "when this device, your phone, your fridge are more than capable"

             "instead of moving the data to the comp,
                we move the comp to data."
            - from
            coupling private intentions over public protocols

  cloud
      creators become product
  grid


Proof-point

built on prior successes

        1. retool platform:
            1. instead of website, users create an app
            - not a website builder
            - w/ latest tech, doable transitioin
            2. (AI makes it awesome w/ minimal effort)
            - for normiess, easy as instagram filters

app|website litmus test

        2. must be significantly better than:
            * web-based incumbents
                & must be eassy-to-custoomize
                , able publish publically
            * app-based incumbents
                & must be hi-perf + secure
                , work w/o internet
            * social network alternatives
                & provide connection to people that matter



separates
    public connections
    private connections

makes possible
    maximize data locality
